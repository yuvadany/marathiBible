1 I call to you, Lord, come quickly to me; hear me when I call to you.
 2 May my prayer be set before you like incense; may the lifting up of my hands be like the evening sacrifice.
 3 Set a guard over my mouth, Lord; keep watch over the door of my lips.
 4 Do not let my heart be drawn to what is evil so that I take part in wicked deeds along with those who are evildoers; do not let me eat their delicacies.
 5 Let a righteous man strike me—that is a kindness; let him rebuke me—that is oil on my head.
 My head will not refuse it, for my prayer will still be against the deeds of evildoers.
 6 Their rulers will be thrown down from the cliffs, and the wicked will learn that my words were well spoken.
 7 They will say, “As one plows and breaks up the earth, so our bones have been scattered at the mouth of the grave.
” 8 But my eyes are fixed on you, Sovereign Lord; in you I take refuge—do not give me over to death.
 9 Keep me safe from the traps set by evildoers, from the snares they have laid for me.
 10 Let the wicked fall into their own nets, while I pass by in safety.
