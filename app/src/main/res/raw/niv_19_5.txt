1 Listen to my words, Lord, consider my lament.
 2 Hear my cry for help, my King and my God, for to you I pray.
 3 In the morning, Lord, you hear my voice; in the morning I lay my requests before you and wait expectantly.
 4 For you are not a God who is pleased with wickedness; with you, evil people are not welcome.
 5 The arrogant cannot stand in your presence.
 You hate all who do wrong; 6 you destroy those who tell lies.
 The bloodthirsty and deceitful you, Lord, detest.
 7 But I, by your great love, can come into your house; in reverence I bow down toward your holy temple.
 8 Lead me, Lord, in your righteousness because of my enemies— make your way straight before me.
 9 Not a word from their mouth can be trusted; their heart is filled with malice.
 Their throat is an open grave; with their tongues they tell lies.
 10 Declare them guilty, O God! Let their intrigues be their downfall.
 Banish them for their many sins, for they have rebelled against you.
 11 But let all who take refuge in you be glad; let them ever sing for joy.
 Spread your protection over them, that those who love your name may rejoice in you.
 12 Surely, Lord, you bless the righteous; you surround them with your favor as with a shield.
