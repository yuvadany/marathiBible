 7 Hopes placed in mortals die with them; all the promise of[a] their power comes to nothing.
 8 The righteous person is rescued from trouble, and it falls on the wicked instead.
 9 With their mouths the godless destroy their neighbors, but through knowledge the righteous escape.
 10 When the righteous prosper, the city rejoices; when the wicked perish, there are shouts of joy.
 11 Through the blessing of the upright a city is exalted, but by the mouth of the wicked it is destroyed.
 12 Whoever derides their neighbor has no sense, but the one who has understanding holds their tongue.
 13 A gossip betrays a confidence, but a trustworthy person keeps a secret.
 14 For lack of guidance a nation falls, but victory is won through many advisers.
 15 Whoever puts up security for a stranger will surely suffer, but whoever refuses to shake hands in pledge is safe.

 22 Like a gold ring in a pig’s snout is a beautiful woman who shows no discretion.
 23 The desire of the righteous ends only in good, but the hope of the wicked only in wrath.
 24 One person gives freely, yet gains even more; another withholds unduly, but comes to poverty.
 25 A generous person will prosper; whoever refreshes others will be refreshed.
 26 People curse the one who hoards grain, but they pray God’s blessing on the one who is willing to sell.
 27 Whoever seeks good finds favor, but evil comes to one who searches for it.
 28 Those who trust in their riches will fall, but the righteous will thrive like a green leaf.

 30 The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life, and the one who is wise saves lives.
 31 If the righteous receive their due on earth, how much more the ungodly and the sinner!
